<h3>I enjoy playing computer games and building pc's. I will also join up with friends to play sports like volleyball or basketball. i have two pets one a litle fluffy dog names curly, she's a Maltese and a Poodle mix. I also have a little orange cat named tommy who just turned a year old. I currently live in oregon and love the sunny weather in the summer but dont mind the rain and staying indoors.</h3>
